I got my driver's license
last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove
through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably
with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything
I'm insecure about
Yeah today
I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could
I ever love someone else
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way
for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay
now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean
what you wrote
in that song about me
'Cause you said forever
now I drive alone past your street
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know
you the way that I do yeah
Today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured
I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way
for no one oh
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay
now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean
what you wrote
in that song about me
'Cause you said forever
now I drive alone past your street
Red lights stop signs
I still see your face
in the white cars
front yards
Can't drive past the places
we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you babe
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice
in the traffic
we're laughing
Over all the noise
God I'm so blue
know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you babe
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way
for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay
now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean
what you wrote
in that song about me
'Cause you said forever
now I drive alone past your street
Yeah you said forever
now I drive alone past your street

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream
one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin' 'bout how small
it looks on you
Ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
ha-ha-ha-ha
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying singin' in harmony
I bet she's braggin'
to all her friends
sayin' you're so unique hm
So when you gonna tell her
that we did that too
She thinks it's special
but it's all reused
That was our place
I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her
when she's with you
Do you get deja vu
when she's with you
Do you get deja vu Ah hmm
Do you get deja vu Huh
Do you call her
almost say my name
'Cause let's be honest
we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think
that I was just your type
And I bet
that she knows Billy Joel
'Cause you played her
Uptown Girl
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her
how you love her
In between the chorus
and the verse Ooh
So when you gonna tell her
that we did that too
She thinks it's special
but it's all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs
she's singing now
when she's with you
Do you get deja vu
when she's with you
Do you get deja vu Oh-oh
Do you get deja vu
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do
that shit too
You're tradin' jackets
like we used to do
Yeah everything is all reused
Play her piano
but she doesn't know Oh oh
That I was the one
who taught you Billy Joel Oh
A different girl now
but there's nothing new
I know you get deja vu
I know you get deja vu
I know you get deja vu
