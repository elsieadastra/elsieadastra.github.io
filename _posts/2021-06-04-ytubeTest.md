I got my driver's license

last week

Just like we always talked about

'Cause you were so excited for me

To finally drive up to your house

But today I drove

through the suburbs

Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably

with that blonde girl

Who always made me doubt

She's so much older than me

She's everything

I'm insecure about

Yeah today

I drove through the suburbs

'Cause how could

I ever love someone else

And I know we weren't perfect

But I've never felt this way

for no one

And I just can't imagine

How you could be so okay

now that I'm gone

Guess you didn't mean

what you wrote

in that song about me

'Cause you said forever

now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired

Of hearing how much I miss you but

I kinda feel sorry for them

'Cause they'll never know

you the way that I do yeah

Today I drove through the suburbs

And pictured

I was driving home to you

And I know we weren't perfect

But I've never felt this way

for no one oh

And I just can't imagine

How you could be so okay

now that I'm gone

I guess you didn't mean

what you wrote

in that song about me

'Cause you said forever

now I drive alone past your street

Red lights stop signs

I still see your face

in the white cars

front yards

Can't drive past the places

we used to go to

'Cause I still fuckin' love you babe

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Sidewalks we crossed

I still hear your voice

in the traffic

we're laughing

Over all the noise

God I'm so blue

know we're through

But I still fuckin' love you babe

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

I know we weren't perfect

But I've never felt this way

for no one

And I just can't imagine

How you could be so okay

now that I'm gone

Guess you didn't mean

what you wrote

in that song about me

'Cause you said forever

now I drive alone past your street

Yeah you said forever

now I drive alone past your street

Car rides to Malibu

Strawberry ice cream

one spoon for two

And tradin' jackets

Laughin' 'bout how small

it looks on you

Ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

ha-ha-ha-ha

Watching reruns of Glee

Bein' annoying singin' in harmony

I bet she's braggin'

to all her friends

sayin' you're so unique hm

So when you gonna tell her

that we did that too

She thinks it's special

but it's all reused

That was our place

I found it first

I made the jokes you tell to her

when she's with you

Do you get deja vu

when she's with you

Do you get deja vu Ah hmm

Do you get deja vu Huh

Do you call her

almost say my name

'Cause let's be honest

we kinda do sound the same

Another actress

I hate to think

that I was just your type

And I bet

that she knows Billy Joel

'Cause you played her

Uptown Girl

You're singin' it together

Now I bet you even tell her

how you love her

In between the chorus

and the verse Ooh

So when you gonna tell her

that we did that too

She thinks it's special

but it's all reused

That was the show we talked about

Played you the songs

she's singing now

when she's with you

Do you get deja vu

when she's with you

Do you get deja vu Oh-oh

Do you get deja vu

Strawberry ice cream in Malibu

Don't act like we didn't do

that shit too

You're tradin' jackets

like we used to do

Yeah everything is all reused

Play her piano

but she doesn't know Oh oh

That I was the one

who taught you Billy Joel Oh

A different girl now

but there's nothing new

I know you get deja vu

I know you get deja vu

I know you get deja vu

Ah
Well good for you
I guess you moved
on really easily
You found a new girl
and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said
that you wanted
to give me the world
Ah-ah-ah-ah
And good for you
I guess that you've been
workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist
I found for you
she really helped
Now you can be a better man
for your brand new girl
Well good for you
You look happy and healthy not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there
without me baby
God I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected
I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Well good for you
I guess you're gettin'
everything you
want Ah
You bought a new car
and your career's really takin'
off Ah
It's like we never even happened
Baby what the fuck is up
with that Ah
And good for you
it's like you never
even met me
Remember when you swore to God
I was the only
Person who ever got you
Well screw that
and screw you
You will never have
to hurt the way
you know that I do
Well good for you
You look happy and healthy not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there
without me baby
God I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected
I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's
like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy is
like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Well good for you
You look happy and healthy not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there
without me baby
Like a damn sociopath
I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected
I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Well good for you
I guess you moved
on really easily

We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine, you know I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?

[Chorus]
Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

[Verse 2]
And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

[Chorus]
I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy
I wish you all the best, really
Say you love her, baby
Just not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
I hope you're happy
Just not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
