I got my driver's license
last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove
through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably
with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything
I'm insecure about
Yeah today
I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could
I ever love someone else
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way
for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay
now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean
what you wrote
in that song about me
'Cause you said forever
now I drive alone past your street
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know
you the way that I do yeah
Today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured
I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way
for no one oh
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay
now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean
what you wrote
in that song about me
'Cause you said forever
now I drive alone past your street
Red lights stop signs
I still see your face
in the white cars
front yards
Can't drive past the places
we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you babe
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice
in the traffic
we're laughing
Over all the noise
God I'm so blue
know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you babe
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way
for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay
now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean
what you wrote
in that song about me
'Cause you said forever
now I drive alone past your street
Yeah you said forever
now I drive alone past your street
